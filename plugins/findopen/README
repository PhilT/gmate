gedit Find Open Plugin
Copyright (C) 2010 Mario Zaizar <mariozaizar@gmail.com>

DESCRIPTION

This plugin makes it much more convenient open related source files. 
Born from the original Snap Open plugin, and inspired by TextMate, 
this plugin will use regular expressions to quickly find files as you type. 

File browser integration: if the 'file browser' integration is enabled
it will use the file browsers 'root' dir as top level dir when searching
for files to open. if file browser is NOT used,  The files suggested are those 
in or below the directory from where gedit was started. 

You can select the file using keyboard arrows, and then hit enter to open that file.
If the file is already open, gedit will switch to the proper tab.
Escape will close the dialog.

HOW TO USE

1) You can launch the window pressing: Ctrl + Alt + F, 
   or selecting "Search" > "Go to File by content" menus.
2) Write some sentence and find all files that contain it.
3) Tip: You can use it with "Snap Open" plugin, and gets all the power! 
   Searching files by file name and file contents :)
