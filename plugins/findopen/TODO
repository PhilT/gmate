TODO

* Add a full-translate using better option.
* Add a better GUI to add folder/files filter.
* Avoid that 'grep' crash when the input text have special characters.
* Stalls if there are many files matched.
* Harmless broken pipe outputs with too many hits.
* 'find' command on every keystroke (not time-limited)
